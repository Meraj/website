```jsx live=true
<Blockquote>
  The CSS rule <Code>-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;</Code> has been
  applied to all fonts.google.com pages where fonts are rendered. This results
  in browsers using the <strong>greyscale antialiasing method</strong> rather
  than default <Em>subpixel rendering</Em> of fonts.{' '}
  <Quote>
    I believe this was probably introduced to get around inconsistencies in
    rendering between browsers

  , particular between Chrome and Safari on MacOS.
