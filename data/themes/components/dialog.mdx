## API Reference

This component inherits the props from the [Radix Dialog](/docs/primitives/components/dialog) primitive.

### Root

Contains all the parts of a dialog.

### Trigger

Wraps the control that will open the dialog.

### Content

Contains content to be rendered in the open dialog. This component is based on the div element.

### Title

An accessible title that is announced when the dialog is opened. This part is based on the [Heading](./heading) component with a pre-defined font size and leading trim on top.

### Description

An optional accessible description that is announced when the dialog is opened. This part is based on the [Text](./text) component with a pre-defined font size.

If you want to remove the description entirely, remove this part and pass `aria-describedby={undefined}` to `Dialog.Content`.

### Close

Wraps the control that will close the dialog.
