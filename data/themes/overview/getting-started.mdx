# Getting started

## Installation

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/themes
```

## Setting up

### 1. Import the CSS file

This may vary depending of your framework of choice, but generally you'll want to import the CSS file at the root of your application.

```ts
import '@radix-ui/themes/dist/index.css';
```

### 2. Wrap your app with our Provider

The Provider component wraps a couple of Radix's primitives providers in one single component for ease of use.

```tsx line=1,5,7
import { Provider } from '@radix-ui/themes';

export default function () {
  return (
    <Provider>
      <YourApp />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

## Usage

You are now ready to use Radix's components in your app:

```tsx
import { Flex, Text, Button } from '@radix-ui/themes';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <Flex direction="column" gap="2">
      <Text>Hello from Radix Themes :)</Text>
      <Button>Get started</Button>
    </Flex>
  );
}
```

You can now take one step further and <Link href="/docs/themes/guides/theme-configuration">configure the theme</Link> to your liking.
