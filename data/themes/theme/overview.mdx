## Anatomy

A theme is comprised of a set of variables that define the appearance of your UI. Not only are these variables consumed directly by components, but they are also codified and exposed via tokens for use in your own custom elements.

We provide a sensible default theme with a reasonable values to get you started, but donâ€™t be afraid to play with the settings to find the right visual style for your application.

The base look and feel of a theme is defined primarily by 7 core values:

- **Accent Scale** is the dominant color within your UI, most commonly used for primary buttons, links and other interactive elements.

- **Gray Scale** defines the neutral colors used for backgrounds, borders, text and other non-interactive elements.

- **Scaling** defines the spacing scale used between elements. Decreasing this is useful in data dense UIs while increasing provides more breathable space in marketing and documentation settings.

- **Radius** defines the border radius applied to components, this affects the overall playful feel of the UI.

- **Text Color** is the color feel of the text.

- **Background Color** is the apps background color.

- **Appearance** is the color scheme applied to components, this is typically light or dark mode.
