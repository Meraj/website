# Using tokens

<Description>
  A short guide on how to use theme tokens to style your components.

## Using the theme

There are two ways of applying theme values to a UI component:

### Using component props

Theme values can be used as prop values on any UI component. For example, adding `margin-right` to a button component can be achieved by using the `mr` prop and passing in a scale value from the spacing scale.

### Overriding with the style prop

Typically components inherently have the props needed to style them, but in some cases you may need to add a style that is not available as a prop or set a value that is outside of the specified prop type.

In this case, you can use the style prop to override the component's default styles. To use theme values with this method, pass the CSS variable name to the CSS property you wish to override. This should be used sparingly, and only when there is no other way to achieve the desired style. For example, to absolute position a box 8px from the top of the page, you can use the style prop to set a top value and pass `--space-2` to it.
